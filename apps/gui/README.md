# Web GUI

Prefer the
[Electron GUI](https://github.com/lucasavila00/LmScript/tree/main/apps/egui). The
webapp cannot communicate with local SGLang servers because of CORS, and many
features are currently missing from the web version.

It is used as a dependency of the
[Electron GUI](https://github.com/lucasavila00/LmScript/tree/main/apps/egui).
